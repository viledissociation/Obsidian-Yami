# Obsidian Yami Theme

## What is it?

This is a theme I made for Obsidian.md. It's based on the Obsidianite theme by Benny Guo, with a few tweaks to make it more to my liking. Now it looks similar to the Yami theme for Vscode. I really like the Yami theme, I already published custom versions of it for Aliucord and Better Discord, so I decided to make a version for Obsidian as well.

I don't really know how good the theme is, I don't work with CSS a lot, so I'm not sure if I did everything right. If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request :>
